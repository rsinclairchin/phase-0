##Release 1


In Ruby, puts will print the output of the code to the screen as well as a newline.

An integer is a whole number, a float is a decimal value.

Integer division only returns integers. Integer division asks the question "How many times does this number go into that number" and does not include any fractions. It's for things that operate as wholes and can't be split up into pieces. Chris Pine includes a great example in his book. He says if you have 9 dollars and a movie ticket costs 2 dollars, you can only buy 4 movie tickets. There are no half-tickets in this equation.

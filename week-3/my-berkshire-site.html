Translating our previous learning with HTML into an actual site was a chance to build something together.  We were able to see our code turn into the website and edit it from there.

We didn't know what "semantic HTML 5 elements" were so that was good to learn.  We used the footer element and found out that it needs to be inside <body> to pass the HTML validator.  It very enlightening to learn more about this aspect of HTML.

We didn't format anything in HTML, it was a bit of challenge to remember not to use formatting though.  We were tempted "we could make that bold", "we could make that smaller" - but we held back.

HTML the good= It's very simple, once you learn a few basics, you end up using the same code again and again.  It's universal, it's the most common code you see on the web.  It's good for displaying information, particularly in lists and with links.

HTML the bad= Semantics- sometimes strange rules and errors.  For example, not being able to use &. Knowing what tags can go instead other tags is tricky. Also, remembering to close every tag that you open can be tricky- but then there are self closing tags as well.

One trick is saying names of the elements like they are words "href""src".  Another trick is using google for quick research- OF COURSE!

  <h1>Version Control Systems</h1>
  <h2>Git and GitHub</h2>
  <h4>Saturday PM, 22 Aug 2015</h4>
</header>
    <p>
      Version Control Systems. VCS. Developers use them to save their work as they go. They make a change to their code, and they save it. Make another change, save. Change, save. Change, save. Every time they save, a new version, draft, snapshot, is made. It creates a whole history book of changes, a log of their progress. If at any point they don't like where they've ended up, they can go back to any one of these save points and start from there. No need to scrap the whole project. Just pick up where things started to go awry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Git is one VCS. It keeps all those history books on the computer. It creates working branches off of the master branch, which can then be merged back together to make a new snapshot of progress.
    </p>
    <p>
      GitHub takes things to the next level. GitHub takes the history books and puts them online. This may not seem like much, but it opens the collaborative floodgates. It means that absolutely anybody with an internet connection can work together on the same project.

    <p>DBC is much more hands-on than I had thought! I'm a little nervous about being given this role, being expected to take control of my experience and forge my own path. I don't feel confident enough in what I'm doing to do that yet. It feels as though there is a lot of support and understanding at DBC, coming from the teachers as well as the students, so maybe after some time to find my footing I'll feel more comfortable jumping into the kitchen. The idea that we are all in this together is very exciting for me. I believe that will lead to stronger relationships, a sense of belonging and loyalty similar to that within a family. And with that sort of togetherness, we can conquer much more than we could solo.</p>
    <p>I am eager for Phase 1 to start so I can start working more closely with all of you! In the meantime, would anybody around the bay area be interested in a little get together? I'd love to start getting to know you.</p>

<!-- For this challenge, we learned little bit about the meta tag within the head tag. Specifically, we used set charset="UTF-8" and researched what that meant. It defines a character set to be used when rendering this page. UTF-8 is the most commonly used charset, and there are other options for other languages that use different alphabets. We found out that it is important to use charset to avoid any miscommunications with the browser. Have you ever seen that little black diamond with a question mark in the middle of it? I think that is the sort of thing that can happen when the browser gets confused and doesn't have a charset defined. So that's why we use it!
We also practiced using semantic HTML with the header tag and the article tag for this challenge. They were useful for defining which part of the page was the blog post and within that, which part was the blog post title.When we looked at it from the Chrome Dev Tools, we were able to see how nicely sectioned everything was, so neat and organized and nested together. This is definitely going to come in handy when we get to CSS, because everything is already nicely parceled and ready to be moved about and styled.
The DOCTYPE has a lot to do with the order in which elements are displayed by a browser. It tells the browswer to which standards the code adheres, and thus renders it accordingly. There's different modes that a browser can render a webpage in, I learned of two: standards-compliant mode and quirks mode. Your webpage will look quirky if rendered in quirks mode, and not in a cute way!
Probably some of the most fun we had this challenge was creating a snippet. Neither of us had any idea what to do in the beginning, but we studied the template, researched and checked out a number of example snippets until something came together. We ran into some trouble with the scope, we weren't sure what it meant or really what was supposed to be in there. Eventually, we tried text.html and got it to work, though we didn't quite know why. I later learned that there is a particular scope that is used for every language, and there's a list out there that our guide linked us to in their comment. Anyways, I am curious to see what snippets other coders have come up with. I'm sure there's some useful ones that I'll want to implement myself! -->

  <h1>Version Control Systems</h1>
  <h2>Git and GitHub</h2>
  <h4>Saturday PM, 22 Aug 2015</h4>

    <p>
      Version Control Systems. VCS. Developers use them to save their work as they go. They make a change to their code, and they save it. Make another change, save. Change, save. Change, save. Every time they save, a new version, draft, snapshot, is made. It creates a whole history book of changes, a log of their progress. If at any point they don't like where they've ended up, they can go back to any one of these save points and start from there. No need to scrap the whole project. Just pick up where things started to go awry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Git is one VCS. It keeps all those history books on the computer. It creates working branches off of the master branch, which can then be merged back together to make a new snapshot of progress.
    </p>
    <p>
      GitHub takes things to the next level. GitHub takes the history books and puts them online. This may not seem like much, but it opens the collaborative floodgates. It means that absolutely anybody with an internet connection can work together on the same project.

    <p>DBC is much more hands-on than I had thought! I'm a little nervous about being given this role, being expected to take control of my experience and forge my own path. I don't feel confident enough in what I'm doing to do that yet. It feels as though there is a lot of support and understanding at DBC, coming from the teachers as well as the students, so maybe after some time to find my footing I'll feel more comfortable jumping into the kitchen. The idea that we are all in this together is very exciting for me. I believe that will lead to stronger relationships, a sense of belonging and loyalty similar to that within a family. And with that sort of togetherness, we can conquer much more than we could solo.</p>
    <p>I am eager for Phase 1 to start so I can start working more closely with all of you! In the meantime, would anybody around the bay area be interested in a little get together? I'd love to start getting to know you.</p>

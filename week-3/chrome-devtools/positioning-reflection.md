##How can you use Chrome's DevTools inspector to help you format or position elements?
It gives you the ability to check and uncheck certain css elements to allow you to see the changes. Having the dev tools within the browser is also useful for seeing immediate changes to your website.


##How can you resize elements on the DOM using CSS?
We resized our elements using height and width, and we experimented using margins and borders as well.


##What are the differences between Absolute, Fixed, Static, and Relative positioning? Which did you find easiest to use? Which was most difficult?
Static positioning is an elements default positioning. It puts the element in the normal flow of the page.
Relative positioning moves the element relative to its static position. You can use top, right, bottom, and left to move the element.
Fixed positioning anchors the element to the viewfinder, so it will not move when scrolling up or down on the webpage.
Absolute positioning is a little tricky. It positions an element relative to its closest positioned ancestor. This one can take some trial and error, but usually it moves relative to the one it wants to sit on top of.
Absolute positioning was easiest for me to use when any sort of layering was involved, whereas relative was easy to use when divs were supposed to sit nicely side by side.


##What are the differences between Margin, Border, and Padding?
The border is the edge of the element, it defines the space wherein the content resides. Padding is the spacing between the border and the content of the element, which is really great for centering things inside of elements. The margin is the bumper that keeps the element a set distance away from the edge of the page and the other elements around it. Kind of like a forcefield.


##What was your impression of this challenge overall? (love, hate, and why?)
At times it was frustrating because we didn't always know how to place things exactly where we wanted them to go. It often felt as though we were fighting with a stubborn element that refused to move, until it suddenly went flying accross the page! It was a lot of trial and error, but that required us to get creative with our problem solving and think of new things to try even when we thought we had tried everything. It was frustrating sometimes, fun sometimes, and hugely rewarding sometimes.

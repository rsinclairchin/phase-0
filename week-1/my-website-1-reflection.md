## 4. Open Source and Repo Setup Reflection

- Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person.
- Describe what open source means.
- What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?
- Assess the importance of using licenses.
- What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?
- Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

To create a repository on GitHub, first navigate to the GitHub website and log in to your account. To the left of your profile picture in the top right corner of the page is a +. Select "New repository" from that dropdown menu. Give the repository a name, pick whether you'd like it to be public or private, and decide if you want to add a license. Click the big green "Create repository" button and do a celebration dance!

To clone your new repository to your computer, visit your repository on github.com/USERNAME/REPONAME.Towards the bottom of the bar on the right of the page is a HTTPS clone URL. Copy that. Open up Terminal and change into the directory that you want to clone the repository into. Then type the command "git clone" followed by the HTTPS clone URL you copied earlier. Hit enter and your repository will be cloned to your computer.

Open source means that the code behind a computer program is available for anybody to see and customize and modify however they like. I think this is fantastic. As a new developer, it gives me a ton of resources to look at to learn how code works. It also makes me feel as though I'm part of a community, one of many. There's something nice about that.

Licensing is an important part of open source. It allows you to free up your code for other people to do with what they will, and reserves whatever rights you want to it. These include distribution rights, attribution rights, and copyrights, to name a few.

I fiiinally got a grasp on git. It just all came together. It seems so simple now, I'm not sure why I was struggling in the previous challenges. I am so happy it clicked!!

#1.1 Think About Time
As I began this challenge, I felt as though I manage my time fairly well. Currently, I have no real method nor do I follow any sort of technique. From time to time I get into a great work flow. When I find myself checking Facebook frequently or unable to concentrate on coding, I take a break. Time management was never something I researched or did intentionally, because I was comfortable working as I was. After being exposed to these ideas and learning that there are things I can do to heighten productivity, I'm curious to find out if they work and eager to try them out.

Time Boxing is about having a set time dedicated to working on something. After the allotted time is up, you review how much work you were able to accomplish. The Pomodoro Technique is an example of Time Boxing. I had heard about this one before, but didn't fully understand it. The idea of taking a 5 minute break between each 25 minute block of work seems like a good way to actually end up working longer. I hear it's a good idea to look away from the computer screen every so often, too, to give your poor eyes a break. The only thing I'm still not completely sure about is how to know how many 25 minute blocks of work it will take to get through a project. I guess my estimations will get better as I get to know how well I work.

The one thing that I have never concerned myself with was focus. I always had my phone sitting next to me and facebook open in one tab, and I'd freely check either while I was working. I'm going to start by simply removing these distractions, and try to go further by meditating every day. This is going to be the biggest thing for me to change about the way that I work, but I believe it will lead to more time in the flow. It's certainly worth trying!
#1.2 The Command Line
A shell is a way to navigate and utilize your computer using a command line and typed out commands. It's a precursor to the GUI. Bash is an example of a shell.

Rote memorization and repetitive drills were probably the most difficult part of this assignment. It felt more like work than like learning, thus I often got bored and wanted to move on. But I pushed on, just as Zed instructed, and I'm now fairly comfortable or at least familiar with all the commands covered. I believe pwd is the most important command, or maybe just the most useful for a beginner like me, because it's easy to get lost when there's no visual tree to show you what's around or where you've gone.

pwd - print working directory, shows you where you are

ls - list, lists everything in your current directory

mv - move, can transfer files from one place to another

cd - change directory, moves you to a directory within your current directory

../ - dub dot slash - moves your working directory up one directory

touch - creates a new file

mkdir - make directory, creates a new directory

less - shows you the contents of a file in scrollable pages

rmdir - remove directory, deletes an empty directory

rm - remove, removes a file

help - man, gives information regarding a command

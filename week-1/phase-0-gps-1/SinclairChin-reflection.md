Prior to the GPS, I was still a little unsure about add/commit/push sequence. I had no idea where merge fit into all this, and I was still making mistakes here and there with my branches. The GPS helped me gain more practice adding, commiting and pushing to GitHub. I also learned a lot of shortcuts, such as 'co' for checkout and auto-tabbing. I got to use more that I knew about, too, like putting -m to commit to add a message and subl to open a file in sublime.


I feel as though I may not have asked many questions throughout this GPS, and in the future I will definitely try to ask more. I did ask about git fetch and how it differs from git pull, and we spent some time after the assignment was completed to look up the answer.


Merging is still a smidgeon confusing for me, but I'm pretty sure that with just a bit more practice I'll get the hang of it. Right now I still run into that error message fairly often reminding me to merge my branches together before deleting them. It's quite helpful, actually! It's like having a sticky note posted up so that I don't forget.


My first experience in a GPS was alright. I definitely learned a lot about pairing. I learned that participation is crucial. I feel like a took a backseat in this pairing, and I did not get as much out of it as I potentially could have. In future pairings, I am going to focus on creating a more equal partnership.

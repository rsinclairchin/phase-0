What is your site's primary goal or purpose? What kind of content will your site feature?

  My target audience is primarily interested in hiring a web developer, and my site is going to address them professionally a mind in business.


What is the primary "action" the user should take when coming to your site? Do you want them to search for information, contact you, or see your portfolio? It's ok to have several actions at once, or different actions for different kinds of visitors.

  First, they will want to check out my portfolio. Then, they will find my contact information and call me in the hopes that somebody else hasn't swept me up already.


What are the main things someone should know about design and user experience?

  People should know that design is about more than how a website looks. It is also about organizing information and making a website useable.

What is user experience design and why is it valuable?

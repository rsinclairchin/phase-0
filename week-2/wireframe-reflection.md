A wireframe is a bare bones blueprint of a website. It shows how information is going to be displayed and helps pick out what will be the most important bits to emphasize. It helps to create a plan for the layout of a website before delving into the details like colour schemes and content.


I did not particularly enjoy wireframing my site. I wanted it to be as minimalistic as possible so there really wasn't much to it. I'd like to try wireframing an already existing website that has a lot going on, maybe a news site! That might be more fun.


My first idea turned out looking a lot like MySpace, and I did not like it at all. I quickly googled portfolio websites and saw a lot of very streamlined, minimalistic designs. I tried to move more in that direction and got something that I liked, but does not have as much content as the instructions suggested.


I didn't have a lot of questions this challenge, it was more just looking at different styles and approaches to design. I really enjoyed looking at portfolio websites other people had put together. The more tedious part was probably reading more about UX design. I know it's important, but I just can't wait to build.
